# Predictive Analysis of Purchase Behavior Using Support Vector Classifiers(Support Vector Machine, python)

# Project Overview
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis to investigate the association between purchase behavior and various features using Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs). The goal is to explore the dataset graphically to identify predictive features and train SVC models to predict purchase behavior accurately. The project leverages Python, scikit-learn, and data visualization techniques to deliver actionable insights for marketing strategies.

# Features
Data exploration and visualization to identify key features influencing purchase behavior.
Implementation of Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs) using scikit-learn.
Model training and evaluation to assess predictive performance.
Insights and recommendations for marketing strategies based on model results.

# Data Exploration
Data exploration involves examining the dataset to understand the relationships between features and purchase behavior. This step includes:
1. Loading the dataset and performing initial data cleaning.
2. Visualizing the distribution of features and their correlation with the target variable (purchase behavior).
3. Identifying outliers and handling missing values.

# Model Training and Evaluation
Model training involves using the SVC algorithm from scikit-learn to predict purchase behavior. This step includes:
1. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Training the SVC model using different hyperparameters.
3. Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Results
The results section includes the evaluation metrics for the SVC model, visualizations of the model's performance.
