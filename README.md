Predictive Analysis of Purchase Behavior Using Support Vector Classifiers(Support Vector Machine, python)

Project Overview
This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis to investigate the association between purchase behavior and various features using Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs). The goal is to explore the dataset graphically to identify predictive features and train SVC models to predict purchase behavior accurately. The project leverages Python, scikit-learn, and data visualization techniques to deliver actionable insights for marketing strategies.

Features
Data exploration and visualization to identify key features influencing purchase behavior.
Implementation of Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs) using scikit-learn.
Model training and evaluation to assess predictive performance.
Insights and recommendations for marketing strategies based on model results.
