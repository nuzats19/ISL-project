# ISL-project
# Predictive Analysis of Purchase Behavior Using Support Vector Classifiers(Support Vector Machine, python)

# Project Overview
The project aims to explore the effectiveness of various machine learning approaches in predicting customer purchasing behavior within the OJ dataset. Specifically, the project evaluates the performance of support vector machines (SVM) with different kernels (linear, radial, and polynomial) in classifying customer preferences for orange juice brands. The key objectives include optimizing model parameters, assessing model accuracy, and identifying the best-performing model to accurately predict customer choices.

# Data Exploration
Clean and prepare the dataset.
Visualize feature distributions and correlations with purchase behavior.
Identify and handle outliers.

# Model Training and Evaluation
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train SVM models with different kernels.
Optimize hyperparameters and evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Results
Present evaluation metrics and visualizations for each SVM model.
Compare kernel performance and identify the best model.
Provide marketing recommendations based on the results.
